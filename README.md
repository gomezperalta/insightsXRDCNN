Electronic resources for the paper named "Insights from the reciprocal space revealed by a convolutional neural network and transfer learning".
This paper is published now in Scripta Materialia (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scriptamat.2025.116697)

The dataset is available in the following link: https://bit.ly/4iivld8 . There, you will find the files xset_macro.npy, xset_0250.npy, xset_0100.npy, and xset_0050.npy. These files correspond to the diffraction pattern modeled under different conditions of crystal sizes (data augmentation). The output data corresponds to latpar.npy. You will also require an additional input tensor to train the base model, which is the file binformula.npy.

You can also find the baseModel in that link. For more details, you can consult the reference.
